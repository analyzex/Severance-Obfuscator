# Severance-Obfuscator

Severance Obfuscator is a powerful Python based tool designed to transform plain Batch scripts into heavily obfuscated, hard to reverse engineer versions. By applying multiple layers of randomization, variable substitution, and control flow manipulation, junk code, it ensures your Batch scripts remain protected against casual analysis and tampering.

# How to Use
  Drag & drop a .bat file onto the Python script
  Get an obfuscated *_protected.bat version
  Test the output to ensure functionality remains intact

âš  Warning: This tool is meant for legal use only protecting scripts. Do not use it to hide malicious code.
